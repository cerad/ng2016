Each tournament is a project.

For 2012 and 2014 the notion of a project was not quite complete.

Have a big project yaml file with all kinds of info.
Maybe put some into tables.

Project
  ProjectDate
  ProjectPerson
  ProjectPersonPlan
  ProjectPersonTeam
  ProjectPersonPerson
  ProjectTeam
  ProjectLevel
  ProjectField
  ProjectVenue
  ProjectGame
  ProjectGameTeam
  ProjectGamePerson
  
Or just use keys like did for 2014.

Be nice to be able to support multiple projects.

Store project slug in:
  config
  session
  route parameter
  query parameter
