These files were copied from 2014.  Only the assign.yml file is actually being used.

There are assign state abbreviations for the view which are being used but 
should probably be moved to a view transformer.

The transitions are being used to make choices for the signup forms.

The actual workflow state changes are being made in the controllers.  
Only a few which actually change the state.

So the two actual workflow objects are not currently being used by 2016.
