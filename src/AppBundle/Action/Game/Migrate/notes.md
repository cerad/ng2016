Early on I wrote an init routine which created 24 teams for each division and all the associated 4 pool games.

The init routine then randomly assigned teams. 

This worked well for testing the schedule development.

Later, as the team counts started to stabilize, a 3 pool template was added for some divisions.

Finally, added some time/field changes for U19 for Sunday to deal with closing the first aid statement.

Overall it worked well.  I was able to rebuild the complete games database when tweaks were needed.

I would perhaps make it a bit more robust.  Changing from 4 pools to three pools was a bit of a hack.

The time/field changes even more so.  The TF changes should have been more independent.

U16B 7x7
