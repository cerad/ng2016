The user object itself is a physical object which, in theory, can exist separate from the project stuff.

However, for ng2016 I am putting most of the functionality under ProjectUser just for simplicity.

It might be useful to try moving some of the functionality to here if time permits.

But for now, this is strictly a place holder directory.
